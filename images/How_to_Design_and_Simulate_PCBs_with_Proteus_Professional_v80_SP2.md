# How to Design and Simulate PCBs with Proteus Professional v8.0 SP2
 
Proteus Professional v8.0 SP2 is a powerful software suite that combines schematic capture, PCB layout and circuit simulation tools for professional PCB design and rapid prototyping. In this article, we will show you how to use Proteus Professional v8.0 SP2 to design and simulate a simple PCB project.

## Step 1: Create a New Project
 
To start a new project in Proteus Professional v8.0 SP2, launch the software and click on the New Project button on the home page. You will be prompted to enter a project name, location and mode. For this example, we will use the name "LED Blinker", save it in the default location and select the "PCB Layout + Schematic Capture + VSM Simulation" mode. Click Next to continue.
 
## Step 2: Add Components to the Schematic
 
After creating a new project, you will see the schematic capture module of Proteus Professional v8.0 SP2. To add components to the schematic, you can use the Component Mode button on the left toolbar or press P on your keyboard. A component browser window will appear, where you can search for components by name, category or library. For this example, we will need an Arduino Uno board, an LED, a resistor and a power source. You can find them in the following libraries:
 
- Arduino Uno: ARDUINO library
- LED: DISCRETE library
- Resistor: RESISTORS library
- Power Source: POWER library

To add a component to the schematic, simply drag and drop it from the component browser window to the schematic editor window. You can also double-click on a component to place it at the cursor position. You can rotate or flip a component by using the R or F keys respectively. You can also edit the properties of a component by double-clicking on it or right-clicking on it and selecting Edit Properties. For this example, we will change the value of the resistor to 220 ohms and the color of the LED to red.
 
## Step 3: Wire Up the Components
 
To wire up the components on the schematic, you can use the Wiring Mode button on the left toolbar or press W on your keyboard. A wiring cursor will appear, which you can use to draw wires between pins of components. To start a wire, click on a pin of a component and drag it to another pin of another component. To end a wire, double-click on a pin or press ESC on your keyboard. You can also use junctions to connect wires at any point by clicking on an existing wire. For this example, we will wire up the components as shown below:

## Step 4: Assign Footprints to Components
 
To assign footprints to components on the schematic, you can use the Footprint Mode button on the left toolbar or press F on your keyboard. A footprint browser window will appear, where you can search for footprints by name, category or library. For this example, we will use the following footprints:

- Arduino Uno: ARDUINO\_UNO\_R3 footprint in ARDUINO library
- LED: LED\_5MM footprint in DISCRETE library
- Resistor: RES\_0207/7 footprint in RESISTORS library
- Power Source: BATTERY\_9V footprint in POWER library

To assign a footprint to a component, simply drag and drop it from the footprint browser window to the component on the schematic. You can also double-click on a footprint to assign it to the selected component. You can rotate or flip a footprint by using the R or F keys respectively. You can also edit the properties of a footprint by double-clicking on it or right-clicking on it and selecting Edit Properties.
