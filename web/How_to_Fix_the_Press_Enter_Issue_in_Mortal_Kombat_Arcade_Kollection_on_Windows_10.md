# How to Fix the "Press Enter" Issue in Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection on Windows 10
 
If you have purchased Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection on Steam and are unable to play it on Windows 10 because of the "Press Enter" issue, you are not alone. Many users have reported that the game does not go beyond the "Press Enter" screen and does not recognize any input from the keyboard or controller. This is because the game relies on an outdated service called Games for Windows Live (GFWL) that is no longer supported by Microsoft.

Fortunately, there is a simple workaround that can help you bypass the GFWL requirement and play the game without any problems. All you need to do is follow these steps:
 
1. Uninstall âMicrosoft Games for Windows â LIVE Redistributableâ and âMicrosoft Games for Windows Marketplaceâ from your system. You can do this by going to Control Panel > Programs and Features and selecting them from the list.
2. Restart your system.
3. Download two GFWL files: xlive.ini and xlive.dll from this link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/be930uac7fnsiuf/MKAK\_fix.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/be930uac7fnsiuf/MKAK_fix.rar?dl=0). The file has Bulletstorm in the title, but don't worry about that. Bulletstorm was also a GFWL title, and these files work with Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection too.
4. Extract the two files from the zip archive to your desktop or any other convenient location. There will be two files: xlive.ini and xlive.dll.
5. Place these files in your Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection install folder. If you purchased the game via Steam, the folder will be located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection.
6. Start the game from Steam. Do not launch MKHDGame.exe directly, as it will not work.
7. Enjoy the game!

Note: You do not need to set any compatibility mode with any previous Windows versions or install GFWL for this workaround to work. You may also need to configure your controller settings from Steam's Big Picture mode if you are using an Xbox One controller or any other controller that is not recognized by the game.
 
This workaround is based on the solutions provided by various users on Steam forums[^1^] [^2^] and Microsoft community[^3^]. We hope this helps you play Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection on Windows 10 without any issues. Have fun!
  
## What is Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection?
 
Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection is a compilation of three classic Mortal Kombat games: Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. It was released in 2011 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows PC. The games are emulated versions of the original arcade versions, with some minor enhancements such as online multiplayer, leaderboards, and achievements/trophies. The collection also features a challenge mode that tests the player's skills in various scenarios.
 
Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection is a must-have for fans of the iconic fighting game series that revolutionized the genre with its brutal fatalities, gore, and violence. The games feature a roster of memorable characters such as Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and many more. The games also have a rich lore and mythology that spans multiple realms and dimensions. The games are known for their fast-paced and intense gameplay, as well as their secrets and easter eggs.
  
## Why is Games for Windows Live a problem?
 
Games for Windows Live (GFWL) was a service that provided online functionality for some PC games published by Microsoft and other publishers. It was launched in 2007 and discontinued in 2014. Some of the features that GFWL offered were online multiplayer, chat, voice communication, achievements, cloud saves, and cross-platform play with Xbox 360.
 
However, GFWL was also widely criticized by gamers and developers for its poor performance, reliability, security, and user-friendliness. Many users experienced issues such as login errors, connection failures, account bans, corrupted saves, and lost progress. Many developers also abandoned GFWL or switched to other platforms such as Steam or Origin. Some games that used GFWL were patched to remove the dependency or provide alternative solutions.
 
Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection was one of the games that used GFWL for its online features. However, since GFWL is no longer supported by Microsoft, the game does not work properly on Windows 10 without the workaround mentioned above. The game also does not support offline mode or local multiplayer without GFWL.
